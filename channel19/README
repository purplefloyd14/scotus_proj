localhost runserver is overridden by daphne which triggers asgi mode for websockets

the django admin is there to delete things

python3 manage.py runserver, python3 manage.py shell (to explore db) 

The db settings are there, db is postgres 

to expose to the world I used 'ngrok http 8000'

there is a redis thing that needs to be active for this to work. The command for that is 'docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:5'

there is also a docker desktop client, and sometimes the task gets stale and has to be killed there before it is restarted cleanly 



if you want to go live on ngrok, you need to go into the room.html file and change the ws:// to wss:// because in the wild clients demand the extra s, which is the same extra s as https and I think stands for 'secure'
